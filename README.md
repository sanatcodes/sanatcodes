I'm a Software Engineer, with a product mindset. I love creating aesthetically pleasing UI, learning new technologies, and working on projects that create large-scale impact. 

## 🏆 Projects

### 🍎 Foodify - TU Dublin President’s Sustainability Innovation Award 2022 | Google Solution challenge 2021 (Semi-finalist)
An app that promotes responsible food consumption by tracking expiry dates. We used Flutter, Google ML kit, and Cloud Firestore to whip this up in less than 3 months!

### 📦 ParcelSure - ChainLink Summer Hackathon 2022
This was a fun one! A Web3 insurance protocol to insure drop-shipped packages, deployed on Ethereum (Rinkeby) built using Solidity, Hardhat, Svelte & Chainlink.

### 📈 Project Growth – Final Year Project 2023
Here, I developed a web application to aggregate trending categories from YouTube, providing users with an analytics dashboard. Check out the interactive graphs and predictions generated from models built on SciKit-Learn!

### 🤖 Give A Go - AI-Powered Job Application Assistant
Currently, I'm managing the development of an integrated suite of AI tools for job seekers. This project is jam-packed with AI goodness including a personalized CV and cover letter generator, a virtual interview simulator, a networking tool, a CV analyzer, and bite-size courses for skill improvement. Stay tuned for more updates!

## 🏞️ Hobbies
When I'm not coding, I'm probably out in the wilderness, exploring the beautiful outdoors through hiking and camping. I also love reading, listening to podcasts, and photography.
